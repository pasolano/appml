# Project 3

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

For this project, I chose Costa Rica as my country. I've been wanting to do a project on it for some time now, since my dad is from there. Below is a map.

And here is a map of the actual population of Costa Rica

## Using two machine learning methods predict population values at 100 x 100 meter resolution throughout your selected country

### Linear Regression Predictions

### Random Forest Predictions

## Validate the two models using different methods presented in this class

### Linear Regression Validation

## Write a report assessing the two approaches and which of the two models was more accurate. Be sure to account for spatial variation throughout your selected location and provide substantive explanations for why those variations occurred
